Create an assembly routine that will use a timer on the Atmel Mega32U4 microcontroller to output musical notes on a speaker.  Submit your assembly routine and a sketch showing the inputs and outputs of the microcontroller.

Inputs:  		4 pushbuttons, from the ECE 375 board
Outputs:  	A variable width pulse generated by a timer.  

The output of the micrcontroller should be designed to connect to an  LM386 audio amplifier IC.  These frequencies should be as close to A4, B4, C5, and D5 as possible.  Hereâ€™s a reference for musical frequencies.

A4: 440 Hz
B4: 466 Hz
C5: 523 Hz
D5: 587 Hz

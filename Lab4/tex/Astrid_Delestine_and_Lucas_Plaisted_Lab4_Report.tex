\section{Introduction}
%This is the first Lab in the ECE 375 series and it covers the setup and compilation of an AVR Assembly Program. The student will learn how how to use the sample Basic Bump Bot assembly file and send the binaries to the AVR Microcontroller board. For the second part of the lab the student will be expected to download and compile the included C sample program and from it learn how to configure the I/O ports of the ATmega32U4 Microcontroller. The student will then write their own C program and upload it to the Microcontroller to verify that it runs as expected. The provided programs have been attached in the source code section of this report.
This is the fourth lab in the ECE 375 series and it covers adding and subtracting words as well as multiplying words together. In this sense words designate 16 bit numbers. It is important to note that this assembly was written for the m128 chipset and not the regular atmetga32u4 chipset. This is due to the fact that we can operate a simulation tool when using the m128 chipset that is not available when we use our regular chipset. The student will write their assembly to do these expected operations with large numbers and is given the expected inputs and can calculate the outputs.

\section{Design}
This lab Lucas and I collaborated and built out ideas for multi-byte addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It was quite interesting to see our ideas collide and how different approaches can be taken to the same problem. Addition can be considered very trivial, however subtraction becomes a little more difficult as the programmer has to consider negative values and if they are possible with this code. In the handout it clearly states that in this lab we will only be dealing with a more simple unsigned subtraction so the result can be held in two 8 bit registers. Next the multiplication of two 24 bit numbers. This will be more difficult than the previous two problems. In this case we decided to solve the problem linearly and not worry about looping or recursion. Finally we move on to the compound function, which uses each of the previously implemented methods to solve the problem of \(((G-H)+I)^2\).

\section{Assembly Overview}
As for the Assembly program an overview can be seen below. It is also important to note that for each of the subroutines all the registers used are pushed and popped to and from the stack unless otherwise stated.

\subsection{Internal Register Definitions and Constants}
The multipurpose register was setup as r16. At r0 and r1 any multiplication output will be set, such that the outputs of any multiplication operation are automatically assigned to them. A default zero register is set to r2. Two other generic variable registers are defined as r3 and r4. Finally two registers named oloop and iloop are used for counting within the assembly itself.

\subsection{Initialization Routine}
Firstly the stack pointer is initialized, then the register defined above as the zero register is cleared.

\subsection{Main Routine}
The main operations that happen in the main routine are those that are initialized below and are called in this order. Firstly the adding operations take place, those being LOADADD16 and ADD16. Next the functions associated with the subtraction operation are called, those being LOADSUB16 and SUB16. Next the functions referencing the MUL24 operation are called. In order they are called LOADMUL24 and MUL24. Finally the compound function set is called, being LOADCOMPOUND and COMPOUND. Once all of these functions have been called the main method loops at the done flag, determining the program to be complete.


\subsection{Subroutines}
	\subsection{ADD16}
	This subroutine adds two 16 bit numbers together. It does this by taking each X Y and Z registers and setting them to operator 1 operator 2 and the location to save the result respectively. Next, using the A variable register as an intermediary the two inputs were added together and saved into the Z register location. Finally if the carry flag is set at the end of the whole operation then we can assume the most significant bit needs to be set to 1, so it is done. 
	
	\subsection{SUB16}
  	This subroutine takes two different inputs and subtracts the first from the second. The X Y and Z registers are initialized at the beginning of this subroutine first, the same way that they are in the add subroutine. In the actual operation part of this subroutine A and B registers are loaded with the lower values of X and Y and subtracted from each other. This is then preformed again to account for the second word. Due to the fact that we do not need to worry about signage these are each saved directly to the location pointed to by Z

\section{Study Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Although we dealt with unsigned numbers in this lab, the ATmega32 micro-controller also has some features which are important for performing signed arithmetic. What does the V flag in the status register indicate? Give an example (in binary) of two 8-bit values that will cause the V flag to be set when they are added together.
    
    \item 
    In the skeleton file for this lab, the .BYTE directive was used to allocate some data memory locations for MUL16’s input operands and result. What are some benefits of using this directive to organize your data memory, rather than just declaring some address constants using the .EQU directive?
    \item 
    In computing, there are traditionally two ways for a microprocessor to listen to other devices and communicate: polling and interrupts. Give a concise overview/description of each method, and give a few examples of situations
    where you would want to choose one method over the other.    
    \item
	Describe the function of each bit in the following ATmega32U4 I/O registers: EICRA, EICRB, and EIMSK. Do not just give a brief summary of these registers; give specific details for each bit of each register, such as its possible values and what function or setting results from each of those values. Also, do not just directly paste your answer from the datasheet, but instead try	to describe these details in your own words.
    
	\item 
	The ATmega32U4 microcontroller uses interrupt vectors to execute particular instructions when an interrupt occurs. What is an interrupt vector? List the interrupt vector (address) for each of the following ATmega32U4 interrupts: Timer/Counter0 Overflow, External Interrupt 6, and Analog Comparator.
	
	
	
	
	\item 
	Microcontrollers often provide several different ways of configuring interrupt triggering, such as level detection and edge detection. Suppose the signal shown in Figure 1 was connected to a microcontroller pin that was configured
	as an input and had the ability to trigger an interrupt based on certain signal conditions. List the cycles (or range of cycles) for which an external interrupt would be triggered if that pin’s sense control was configured for: (a) rising
	edge detection, (b) falling edge detection, (c) low level detection, and (d) high level detection. Note: There should be no overlap in your answers, i.e., only one type of interrupt condition can be detected during a given cycle.

\section{Difficulties}
This lab was not too difficult, however determining exactly how the marquee needed to work was definitely a challenge. After sorting out the bugs, it was extremely exciting to see text show up on the display.  

\section{Conclusion}
This lab really helped teach just how peripherals can work, and how the ATMEGA32U4 handles certain peripherals. Several parts were challenging however these stimulating moments allowed the student to learn and understand what they needed to do at the same time.
